There are abrasions over his scalp and face and a 1x3 cm area of ecchymosis above his right eye. Abdominal examination shows suprapubic tenderness. There is a scant amount of blood at the urethral meatus. There is no cervical spinal tenderness. Musculoskeletal examination shows tenderness and ecchymosis over his right distal forearm. An x-ray of the pelvis shows a fracture of the pelvic ramus. A CT scan of the head and neck show no abnormalities. IV pyelogram was then performed.```\n",
