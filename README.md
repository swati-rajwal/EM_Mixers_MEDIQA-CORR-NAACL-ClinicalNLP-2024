# Knowledge-Enhanced Few-Shot In-Context Learning for Medical Error Detection & Correction

## 🎯Objective
In this task, we seek to address the problem of identifying and correcting (common sense) medical errors in clinical notes. From a human perspective, these errors require medical expertise and knowledge to be both identified and corrected. 

## 🚧Methods
We used OpenAI's GPT-4 API with RAG for error detection and sentence correction.

## 🏃‍♂️To Run the code
1. This code used Azure OAI GPT API
2. Ensure the dataset can be found
3. Necessary installations are provided at the top of the notebooks
4. Run the scripts
