# EM_Mixers_MEDIQA-CORR-NAACL-ClinicalNLP-2024
Code submission for the MEDIQA-CORR @ NAACL-ClinicalNLP 2024 Shared Task by Team EM_Mixers

## 🎯Objective
In this task, we seek to address the problem of identifying and correcting (common sense) medical errors in clinical notes. From a human perspective, these errors require medical expertise and knowledge to be both identified and corrected.

We used OpenAI's GPT-4 API with RAG for error detection, and sentence correction.

## 🏃‍♂️To Run the code
1. This code used Azure OAI GPT API
2. Ensure the dataset can be found
3. Necessary installations are provided at the top of the notebooks
4. Run the scripts
